# Cart App

## Project setup

    1. Install VS code
    2. Install extension live server
    3. Open the folder CartApp and click on Go Live in the bottom right corner


### Tech Stack

    1. HTML5, CSS3
    2. Bootstrap 5 
    3. jQuery 3.6 


### Approach

    First I created a checklist with all the items like UI, functional part, and other minor to do's. 
    Then prioritized them and started working on them. 

    I covered the UI part first. Then once UI was done, I worked on the cart functionality. 
    At last I kept the research part in order to cover the things that I know first. 

### Estimated Time

    It took around 14 hours to complete the task

    
### Pending bits

    I have tried to complete most of the part but the animation part and options part is pending.  
    The animation part was bit research work for me. I tried but it took more time than expected. And, due to this I didnt got much time to focus on the options part.
